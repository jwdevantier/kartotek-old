# Kartotek

*This application is quite bare-bones and still under trial and development.*

Kartotek is a small, self-contained application which I use to search among and discover relationships between my notes.

The application is inspired by the Zettelkasten method and thus favors a style of taking notes where each note is short, covering a single idea and where a lot of emphasis is placed on linking notes with other, related concepts.

This application focuses exclusively on searching through your notes. You can search by title, tags and relationships. That is `r:hello.md` will list all notes which link to `hello.md`.

For more information on the search/query language, see [search help](resources/search-help.md).
